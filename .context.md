### Key Insight: `ios/` is NOT committed
The `ios/` folder is in `.gitignore`. It's fully generated by `npx expo prebuild --platform ios --clean` from `app.json` config. **Never manually edit files in `ios/`** — they will be overwritten. If you need to change native project settings, do it via Expo config plugins in `app.json` or a custom config plugin.

## 3. Architecture Overview

### 3.1 Navigation Flow

```
App.tsx checks walletService.hasWallet()
  ├── No wallet  → WelcomeScreen → CreateWalletScreen / ImportWalletScreen → HomeScreen
  └── Has wallet → HomeScreen
                     ├── Send → SendScreen
                     ├── Receive → ReceiveScreen
                     └── Settings → SettingsScreen
```

Navigation uses `@react-navigation/native-stack` (native stack navigator). The initial route is determined asynchronously at app startup.

### 3.2 Service Layer

#### `WalletService` (src/services/wallet.ts)
- Singleton instance (`export default new WalletService()`)
- **Storage:** `expo-secure-store` on native, `localStorage` on web
- **Key derivation:** BIP-39 mnemonic → ethers.js HDNode → Koinos derivation path `m/44'/659'/{account}'/0/0` (coin type 659 = Koinos)
- **Signer:** `koilib.Signer` created from derived private key (compressed = true)
- **Caching:** `loadWallet()` caches the signer/address in memory after first derivation. This avoids re-deriving the HD key on every screen navigation.
- **Import formats:** BIP-39 mnemonic (12 words) or WIF private key
- **Storage format:** Raw mnemonic string, or `wif:<key>` prefixed string

#### `KoinosService` (src/services/koinos.ts)
- Singleton instance
- Uses `koilib` library (Provider, Contract, Signer, utils)
- **RPC endpoint:** Default `https://api.koinos.io`, user-configurable via Settings, persisted in AsyncStorage
- **KOIN contract:** `19GYjDBVXU7keLbYvMLazsGQn3GTWHjHkK` (8 decimals)
- **VHP contract:** `12Y5vW6gk8GceH53YfRkRre2Rrcsgw7Naq` (8 decimals)
- **Token ABI:** Inline protobuf-based ABI definition (balance_of, transfer, etc.)
- **Transactions:** `sendKoin()` / `sendVhp()` — creates contract call, submits, waits for mining confirmation
- **RC limit:** Hardcoded to `100000000` (1 KOIN worth of mana) per transaction

### 3.3 Token Types
| Token | Contract Address | Decimals | Description |
|-------|-----------------|----------|-------------|
| KOIN | `19GYjDBVXU7keLbYvMLazsGQn3GTWHjHkK` | 8 | Main Koinos token |
| VHP | `12Y5vW6gk8GceH53YfRkRre2Rrcsgw7Naq` | 8 | Virtual Hash Power (staking/mining) |

## 4. The Crypto Polyfill System (CRITICAL)

This is the most important architectural detail. **If you break this, transaction signing stops working.**

### 4.1 The Problem

The signing flow is:
```
koilib → @noble/secp256k1 v1.7.2 → crypto.subtle.importKey/sign/digest
```

`@noble/secp256k1` v1.7.2 performs HMAC-SHA256 for deterministic ECDSA (RFC 6979). It detects `self.crypto` and tries to use `crypto.subtle` for this. In React Native:
- `react-native-get-random-values` polyfills `self.crypto.getRandomValues` ✅
- But it does NOT provide `self.crypto.subtle` ❌
- So `self.crypto` exists, `secp256k1` detects it, but `crypto.subtle` is `undefined`
- Result: `TypeError: Cannot read property 'importKey' of undefined`

### 4.2 The Solution (in index.ts)

We polyfill `self.crypto.subtle` with a minimal implementation using `@noble/hashes` (pure JavaScript, no native dependencies):

```typescript
import { hmac } from '@noble/hashes/hmac';
import { sha256 } from '@noble/hashes/sha256';

if (typeof self !== 'undefined' && self.crypto && !self.crypto.subtle) {
  (self.crypto as any).subtle = {
    async digest(algorithm, data) {
      // SHA-256 only — used by secp256k1 for message hashing
      return sha256(new Uint8Array(data)).buffer as ArrayBuffer;
    },
    async importKey(_format, keyData, ...) {
      // Stores raw key bytes — secp256k1 passes HMAC key material here
      return { keyData: new Uint8Array(keyData) };
    },
    async sign(_algorithm, key, data) {
      // HMAC-SHA256 — the core operation secp256k1 needs for RFC 6979
      return hmac(sha256, key.keyData, new Uint8Array(data)).buffer as ArrayBuffer;
    },
  };
}
```

### 4.3 Why Other Approaches Failed

| Approach | Why It Failed |
|----------|--------------|
| `react-native-quick-crypto` | Requires NitroModules native build; crashes in Expo Go; was removed |
| `expo-crypto` | Provides `digestStringAsync` but not the `SubtleCrypto` interface that secp256k1 expects |
| Override `secp.utils.hmacSha256Sync` | Metro bundles ESM and CJS as separate module instances. The secp256k1 instance that koilib imports is NOT the same one you import directly. Your override never reaches the actual instance used for signing. |
| `@noble/secp256k1` v2.x | Breaking API changes, not compatible with koilib v9.2.0 |

### 4.4 Polyfill Load Order (index.ts)

The order of imports in `index.ts` is **critical** and must not be changed:

```
1. react-native-get-random-values  → adds self.crypto.getRandomValues
2. @ethersproject/shims             → process, nextTick polyfills
3. buffer                           → global Buffer
4. @noble/hashes/hmac + sha256      → used to build subtle polyfill
5. crypto.subtle polyfill           → patches self.crypto.subtle
6. expo registerRootComponent       → starts the app (any koilib import after this point sees subtle)
```

**Rule:** NEVER import koilib or any module that transitively imports `@noble/secp256k1` before the polyfill is applied. The polyfill must run before any crypto library tries to detect `crypto.subtle`.

---

## 5. Build & Compilation Pipeline

### 5.1 Development Modes

There are **three** ways to run the app:

#### Mode A: Expo Go (Simulator — fastest iteration)
```bash
./start-ios.sh
# or: npx expo start --ios --localhost --go
```
- Uses the pre-built Expo Go app on the iOS Simulator
- No native compilation needed
- Limited to APIs included in Expo Go
- Cannot use custom native modules
- **Use for:** UI development, testing JS logic

#### Mode B: Expo Go (Physical Device)
```bash
npx expo start --go
```
- Install Expo Go from the App Store
- Scan QR code with iPhone camera
- Same limitations as Mode A
- **Use for:** Quick testing on real hardware

#### Mode C: Native Build (Physical Device — full capability)
```bash
npx expo prebuild --platform ios --clean
npx expo run:ios --device
```
- Compiles a real native binary with Xcode
- Full access to all native modules
- Required for production / App Store builds
- **Use for:** Final testing, production deployment

### 5.2 Native Build Process (Detailed)

#### Step 1: Generate native project
```bash
npx expo prebuild --platform ios --clean
```
This generates the `ios/` directory from `app.json`:
- Creates `KoinosWallet.xcodeproj` and `KoinosWallet.xcworkspace`
- Generates `Podfile` from Expo dependencies
- Runs `pod install` to fetch CocoaPods dependencies
- Configures signing, bundle ID, splash screen, etc.

The `--clean` flag deletes and regenerates from scratch. Use it when:
- You changed `app.json` (bundle ID, permissions, plugins)
- You added/removed native dependencies in `package.json`
- The build is broken and you want a clean slate

#### Step 2: Build and install
```bash
npx expo run:ios --device
```
Under the hood, this runs:
1. `xcodebuild` to compile all native code:
   - Hermes JavaScript engine (C++)
   - React Native bridge (Obj-C/C++)
   - All CocoaPods dependencies (native modules)
   - The KoinosWallet app target
2. Code signing with your Apple Developer certificate
3. `xcrun devicectl` to install the `.app` on the connected iPhone
4. Launches the app on the device

#### Step 3: Start Metro bundler
```bash
npx expo start --dev-client
```
The native app loads the JavaScript bundle from Metro over the network:
- Metro serves on port 8081
- The dev client discovers the server via Bonjour/mDNS on the local network
- If auto-discovery fails, manually enter: `http://<MAC_IP>:8081`
- Find Mac IP: `ipconfig getifaddr en0`

#### Production Build (embedded JS, no Metro needed)
```bash
npx expo run:ios --device --configuration Release
```
This embeds the JS bundle inside the binary — the app runs standalone.

### 5.3 Known Build Issues & Solutions

#### Sandbox Permission Denial
```
Sandbox: bash deny(1) file-write-create .../KoinosWallet.app/ip.txt
```
**Cause:** Xcode's `ENABLE_USER_SCRIPT_SANDBOXING = YES` blocks React Native's "Bundle React Native code and images" build phase from writing files.
**Fix:** In `ios/KoinosWallet.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj`, change both occurrences:
```
ENABLE_USER_SCRIPT_SANDBOXING = NO;
```
Then clean DerivedData: `rm -rf ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/KoinosWallet-*`
**Note:** Since `ios/` is regenerated by prebuild, you may need to re-apply this fix after each `prebuild --clean`. Consider adding an Expo config plugin to automate it.

#### Device Name Regex Bug
If the iPhone name contains special regex characters (apostrophe, parenthesis), Expo CLI crashes:
```
Invalid regular expression: /Pablos iPhone 17 (/i: Unterminated group
```
**Fix:** Pass the device UDID directly:
```bash
xcrun devicectl list devices   # Find the device ID
npx expo run:ios --device <DEVICE_ID>
```

#### "Profile has not been explicitly trusted by the user"
**Cause:** Free Apple Developer accounts require manual trust on first install.
**Fix:** On iPhone → Settings → General → VPN & Device Management → Trust your developer profile.

#### "No development servers found" (Dev Client)
**Cause:** The native app can't find the Metro bundler.
**Fix:** Start Metro with `npx expo start --dev-client`, then in the app enter `http://<MAC_IP>:8081` manually.

#### Disk Space Issues
Native builds require ~5GB+ of disk space for DerivedData. Clean with:
```bash
rm -rf ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/*
rm -rf ~/Library/Developer/CoreSimulator/Caches/*
xcrun simctl delete unavailable
```

## 6. Key Dependencies & Their Roles

| Package | Version | Role | Notes |
|---------|---------|------|-------|
| `koilib` | ^9.2.0 | Koinos blockchain SDK (Provider, Contract, Signer, utils) | Depends on @noble/secp256k1 v1.7.2 |
| `@noble/secp256k1` | 1.7.2 | ECDSA signing (secp256k1 curve) | Transitive via koilib — uses crypto.subtle |
| `@noble/hashes` | (transitive) | SHA-256, HMAC — used in our crypto.subtle polyfill | Pure JS, no native deps |
| `ethers` | ^5.8.0 | HD wallet derivation (HDNode.fromMnemonic) | Only v5 — NOT ethers v6 |
| `@ethersproject/shims` | ^5.8.0 | process/nextTick polyfills for ethers in React Native | Must load before ethers |
| `bip39` | ^3.1.0 | BIP-39 mnemonic generation and validation | 12-word English wordlist |
| `react-native-get-random-values` | ~1.11.0 | Polyfills crypto.getRandomValues for React Native | MUST be first import in index.ts |
| `expo-secure-store` | ^15.0.8 | Encrypted key storage (Keychain on iOS) | Stores mnemonic/WIF |
| `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage` | ^2.2.0 | General persistent storage | Stores RPC URL preference |
| `react-native-qrcode-svg` | ^6.3.21 | QR code generation for receive screen | Depends on react-native-svg |
| `expo-clipboard` | ~8.0.8 | System clipboard access | Copy address, paste address |
| `expo-camera` | ~17.0.10 | Camera access for QR scanning | (Planned — not yet used) |
| `buffer` | ^6.0.3 | Node.js Buffer polyfill for React Native | Required by koilib/ethers |

### Removed Packages (DO NOT RE-ADD)
| Package | Why Removed |
|---------|------------|
| `react-native-quick-crypto` | Crashes in Expo Go (requires NitroModules native build). Incompatible with the Expo managed workflow. Our pure-JS polyfill replaces it. |
| `expo-crypto` | Does not provide SubtleCrypto interface. Only offers `digestStringAsync`. Not useful for secp256k1's needs. |
| `expo-dev-client` | Was removed from package.json dependencies (Expo SDK 54 includes it automatically). |

## 10. Free Mana System (CRITICAL — Hard-Won Knowledge)

> **This section documents 6+ agent sessions of debugging.** Read it fully before modifying
> anything related to mana, transactions, or free mana. Every detail matters.

### 10.1 Koinos Mana & RC System — Fundamentals

On Koinos, there are **no gas fees**. Instead, users spend **mana** (also called **RC** — Resource Credits) to execute transactions. Key properties:

| Property | Detail |
|----------|--------|
| **RC = mana** | They're the same thing, measured in satoshis (8 decimals). `1 KOIN = 100,000,000 RC` |
| **Source** | Mana comes from holding KOIN tokens. Max mana = KOIN balance |
| **Regeneration** | Linear over **5 days** (432,000,000 ms). From 0 → max over 5 days |
| **Not consumed permanently** | Mana regenerates — it's like a rechargeable battery, not a fuel tank |
| **Used for** | Every transaction (transfers, contract calls, etc.) consumes RC |

### 10.2 The KOIN Contract Mana Constraint (THE Critical Discovery)

**This is the #1 thing that tripped up 6 consecutive agent sessions.** The KOIN smart contract (`koin.cpp` in `koinos-contracts-cpp`) has this check in its `transfer()` function:

```cpp
if (from_bal_obj.mana() < value)
  fail("account 'from' has insufficient mana for transfer");
```

**What this means:**
- To send X KOIN, the sender MUST have `mana >= X` — **regardless of who pays the transaction fee**
- This is a **contract-level check**, not a protocol-level check
- Setting a third-party payer does NOT bypass this
- The VHP contract does NOT have this check — VHP transfers have no mana constraint

**Why this exists:** It's an anti-spam measure. Without it, someone could create many accounts with tiny KOIN balances and spam transfers using a free mana payer.

**Practical impact:**
- User with 16 KOIN balance but only 0.8 KOIN of regenerated mana → can only send 0.8 KOIN (not 16)
- User must wait for mana to regenerate to send more
- When mana is fully regenerated (mana = balance), user CAN send entire balance if using free mana payer (fee covered by payer)
- Without free mana payer, can never fully empty wallet (always need mana for tx fee too)

### 10.3 Contract Addresses

| Contract | Address | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| **KOIN** | `19GYjDBVXU7keLbYvMLazsGQn3GTWHjHkK` | Main Koinos token (KRC-20) |
| **VHP** | `12Y5vW6gk8GceH53YfRkRre2Rrcsgw7Naq` | Virtual Hash Power token |
| **Free Mana Sharer** | `162GhJwsciDiKsgwzj2t6VoFHt3RMzGKdG` | Community-funded payer (~12,500 KOIN RC) |
| **Mana Meter** | `1MqveNK3piSGPHGocsRUCVhpCPLgQA58K9` | Dry-run estimation payer (~40B RC = 400 KOIN) |

### 10.4 The Three-Phase + Retry Approach (How Our Free Mana Works)

This is modeled after Kondor wallet's implementation. Both `sendKoin()` and `sendVhp()` in `src/services/koinos.ts` follow this pattern when `useFreeMana` is enabled:

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Pre-flight check (KOIN only):                            │
│   accountMana >= transferAmount?                         │
│   If not → throw error with recharge time estimate       │
└──────────────────────────┬───────────────────────────────┘
                           ▼
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Phase 1: Mana Meter Dry-Run                              │
│   • Build TX with mana meter as payer (huge RC budget)   │
│   • send({ broadcast: false }) → get actual rc_used      │
│   • Purpose: discover how much RC the operation needs    │
└──────────────────────────┬───────────────────────────────┘
                           ▼
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Phase 2: Free Mana Sharer Dry-Run (with retry loop)      │
│   • Set rcLimit = 1.1 × rc_used from Phase 1             │
│   • Set payer = FREE_MANA_SHARER                         │
│   • Dry-run → if "insufficient rc":                      │
│     ├── Bump rcLimit += 1 KOIN (100,000,000 satoshis)    │
│     ├── Re-sign and retry                                │
│     └── Up to 5 attempts                                 │
│   • Purpose: account for free mana sharer's authorize()  │
│     overhead (not captured in Phase 1's mana meter run)  │
└──────────────────────────┬───────────────────────────────┘
                           ▼
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Phase 3: Broadcast                                       │
│   • Re-sign TX with validated rcLimit                    │
│   • tx.send() → broadcast to network                     │
│   • Wait for mining confirmation                         │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Why the retry loop?**  
The free mana sharer's `authorize()` function runs additional logic (signature verification, etc.) that consumes extra RC. The mana meter dry-run in Phase 1 uses a different payer, so it doesn't capture this overhead. Kondor solves this the same way — retry with increasing rcLimit until the dry-run passes.

### 10.5 SendScreen Mana Integration

The `SendScreen.tsx` has several mana-aware features:

#### MAX Button (mana-capped)
```
maxSend = Math.min(balance, currentMana)
```
- For KOIN: caps at whichever is lower — balance or regenerated mana
- If NOT using free mana: also reserves 1.5× estimated tx fee
- For VHP: no mana cap (VHP contract has no mana check)

#### Auto-Detect Free Mana (useEffect on amount change)
- For KOIN: enables free mana when `postTransferMana < manaCost × 3`
- For VHP: enables free mana when `currentMana < manaCost × 3`
- Only enables if free mana sharer is available (has RC)

#### Validation (mana check)
- Blocks KOIN sends where `amount > currentMana`
- Shows recharge time estimate: "You can send X KOIN in ~2d 19h"
- When not using free mana, also checks remaining mana covers tx fee

#### Mana Recharge Timer
- Shows amber banner when entered amount > currentMana but <= balance
- Calculates: `deficit / regenRate` where `regenRate = maxMana / 5_days`
- Formats as "~Xd Xh", "~Xh Xm", or "~Xm"

### 10.6 What FAILED (Don't Repeat These Mistakes)

| Attempt | Approach | Why It Failed |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 1 | Hardcoded `rcLimit = 100,000,000` (1 KOIN) with free mana sharer | KOIN contract mana check still fails — RC limit is not the issue |
| 2 | `rcLimit = estimate × 5` | Same — mana check is contract-level, not RC-level |
| 3 | Raw estimate without multiplier | Same root cause |
| 4 | Generous `rcLimit = 10 KOIN` | Same — the error is about `from.mana`, not about RC budget |
| 5 | Two-phase mana meter (no retry) | Phase 1 worked, but Phase 2 failed with "insufficient rc" because free mana sharer's authorize() adds overhead |
| 6 | **Three-phase + retry** | ✅ **WORKS** — confirmed mined in block 33,218,462 |

**The key insight:** There are TWO separate mana concerns for KOIN transfers:
1. **Transaction fee (RC):** Who pays the compute cost → solved by payer/rcLimit
2. **Transfer amount:** KOIN contract requires `from.mana >= amount` → solved by UI validation/MAX cap

Most failures came from confusing #1 with #2.

## 11. HomeScreen Battery Widget

The HomeScreen displays mana as a battery-style widget:

- **Visual:** Horizontal battery bar with cap on the right side
- **Fill:** Proportional to `manaPercent = currentMana / maxMana`
- **Colors:** Green (>25%), Yellow (10-25%), Red (<10%)
- **Glow effect:** Right edge of fill bar has a glow for visual polish
- **Text:** Shows percentage inside the bar
- **Auto-refresh:** Polls every 30 seconds when mana < 100% to show regeneration

## 12. Common Tasks for AI Agents

### Adding a New Screen
1. Create `src/screens/NewScreen.tsx`
2. Add route type to `RootStackParamList` in `App.tsx`
3. Add `<Stack.Screen>` in `App.tsx`
4. Navigate with `navigation.navigate('NewScreen')`

### Adding a New Token
1. Add contract address constant in `src/services/koinos.ts`
2. Add balance fetch method (reuse existing `tokenAbi` — KRC-20 standard)
3. Add send method following `sendKoin`/`sendVhp` pattern (including free mana three-phase approach)
4. Update `SendScreen.tsx` token selector
5. Update `HomeScreen.tsx` balance display
6. **Check if the token contract has a mana constraint** like KOIN does — if so, add mana cap in SendScreen

### Modifying Native iOS Configuration
**DO NOT** edit files in `ios/` directly. Instead:
1. Change `app.json` for standard Expo config
2. For advanced settings, create an Expo config plugin
3. Run `npx expo prebuild --platform ios --clean` to regenerate

### Updating Dependencies
```bash
npx expo install <package>     # Use this for Expo-compatible versions
npm install <package>           # For non-Expo packages
npx expo prebuild --clean       # Regenerate native project if native deps changed
```

## 13. Wallet Derivation Details

For reference and debugging:

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **BIP-44 Path** | `m/44'/659'/0'/0/0` |
| **Coin Type** | 659 (Koinos) |
| **Key Compression** | `compressed: true` (IMPORTANT — wrong compression = wrong address) |
| **Address Format** | Base58 (Bitcoin-style), 26-35 characters |
| **Compatible With** | Kondor browser wallet (same derivation path) |
| **Test Address** | `17Gvjva6PE4ApYSNiQEvDi8jYeuebGRnnL` |

---

## 14. Decimal / Locale Handling

Some locales use comma as decimal separator (e.g., Spanish: `0,120` instead of `0.120`). JavaScript's `parseFloat("0,120")` returns `NaN`. 

**Fix applied in SendScreen.tsx:** All amount inputs are normalized with `.replace(',', '.')` before:
1. Validation (`parseFloat`)
2. Confirmation dialog display
3. Passing to `koinosService.sendKoin()`/`sendVhp()`

If adding new numeric inputs, always normalize commas to dots before parsing.

---

## 15. Runtime Warnings (Safe to Ignore)

These appear in the Metro console and are harmless:

1. **`@noble/hashes/crypto.js` not listed in "exports"**
   - Metro falls back to file-based resolution. The import works fine.

2. **`SafeAreaView has been deprecated`**
   - From React Native core. Plan to migrate to `react-native-safe-area-context`.

3. **`Unexpected devicectl JSON version output`**
   - Xcode/devicectl version mismatch warning. Device deployment still works.

---

## 16. Security Considerations

- **Mnemonic/WIF** stored in `expo-secure-store` (iOS Keychain, Android Keystore)
- **Private key** only exists in memory as a `Signer` instance — never logged or transmitted
- The `signer` is cached in the `WalletService` singleton for the session lifetime
- **RPC URL** stored in `AsyncStorage` (not sensitive)
- **No analytics, no telemetry, no remote logging** — fully local wallet
- **Debug logging:** Currently extensive `console.log` statements in SendScreen.tsx and koinos.ts for development. **Remove before production release.**

## 17. Information Sources & References

This section documents where information was gathered from, so future agents know where to look for Koinos-specific details.

### 17.1 Primary Code References (Local Workspace)

| Source | Path | What It Provides |
|--------|------|-----------------|
| **Kondor wallet** | `/Users/pgarcgo/code/kondor/` | Reference implementation for free mana, mana meter, transaction building. Our three-phase approach is directly modeled after Kondor's `sendTransaction()` logic. |
| **koinos-chain** | `/Users/pgarcgo/code/koinos_code/koinos-chain/` | C++ chain node — protocol-level RC/mana behavior |
| **koinos-contracts-cpp** | GitHub: `koinos/koinos-contracts-cpp` | **Source of truth for the KOIN contract mana check.** File `contracts/koin/koin.cpp` contains `if (from_bal_obj.mana() < value) fail(...)`. This is the contract-level constraint that caps KOIN transfers at sender's mana. |
| **kcli** | `/Users/pgarcgo/code/koinos_code/kcli/` | CLI tool with working token ABIs. Our `tokenAbi` was taken from kcli's proven ABI definitions. |
| **koilib** | npm: `koilib@9.2.0` | The official Koinos JavaScript SDK. Source code on GitHub: `joticajulian/koilib`. Key classes: `Provider`, `Contract`, `Signer`, `Transaction`, `utils`. |

### 17.2 Key GitHub Repositories

| Repository | URL | Relevance |
|------------|-----|-----------|
| **koilib** | `github.com/joticajulian/koilib` | JS SDK — Transaction class, Provider API, utils.parseUnits/formatUnits |
| **Kondor** | `github.com/joticajulian/kondor` | Browser wallet by the same author as koilib. Reference for free mana, mana meter, payer/payee fields, dry-run approach. Key files: `src/ts/background/` and transaction signing logic. |
| **koinos-contracts-cpp** | `github.com/koinos/koinos-contracts-cpp` | System contracts source. `koin.cpp` for the mana constraint, `vhp.cpp` for VHP (no mana constraint). |
| **Free Mana Sharer** | `github.com/joticajulian/free-mana-sharer` | Source code for the free mana sharer contract at `162GhJwsciDiKsgwzj2t6VoFHt3RMzGKdG`. Its `authorize()` function is why we need the retry loop. |
| **koinos-proto** | `github.com/koinos/koinos-proto` | Protobuf definitions for all Koinos types (transactions, operations, receipts, etc.) |

### 17.3 Koinos RPC API

| Endpoint | Method | What We Use It For |
|----------|--------|-------------------|
| `https://api.koinos.io` | Default mainnet RPC | All blockchain queries |
| `provider.getAccountRc(address)` | `chain.get_account_rc` | Get current mana (RC) for an address — used for mana display, pre-flight checks, free mana sharer availability |
| `provider.getNonce(address)` | `chain.get_account_nonce` | Transaction nonce (auto-incremented) |
| `provider.getHeadInfo()` | `chain.get_head_info` | Chain info (head block, chain ID) |
| `tx.send({ broadcast: false })` | `chain.submit_transaction` (simulate) | Dry-run: validates TX without broadcasting — returns `rc_used` |
| `tx.send()` | `chain.submit_transaction` | Broadcast TX to network |
| `contract.functions.balance_of()` | `chain.read_contract` | Read token balance (KRC-20 standard) |

### 17.4 Koinos Protocol Details Learned Through Debugging

These are things **not well documented** that we learned empirically:

1. **Mana regeneration is linear over 5 days (432,000,000 ms)** — from 0 to maxMana (= KOIN balance). No compounding, no acceleration.

2. **`payer` vs `payee` fields in transaction header:**
   - `payer`: who pays the RC (mana) for the transaction fee
   - `payee`: who initiated the transaction (the user)
   - Setting payer ≠ payee activates the payer's `authorize()` contract function

3. **Mana meter contract (`1MqveNK3piSGPHGocsRUCVhpCPLgQA58K9`)** has ~40 billion RC (400 KOIN). It's used specifically for dry-run estimation — it has enough RC to simulate any transaction. It is NOT used for broadcasting.

4. **Free mana sharer's `authorize()` overhead:** When a TX uses the free mana sharer as payer, the sharer's `authorize()` function runs and consumes additional RC on top of the operation itself. This overhead is NOT captured by the mana meter dry-run (which uses a different payer). The fix is to retry Phase 2 dry-run with increasing rcLimit (+1 KOIN per attempt).

5. **`Transaction.computeTransactionId(header)`** must be called after modifying any header field (payer, rcLimit, etc.) — the transaction ID is a hash of the header.

6. **Signatures must be cleared and re-signed** after any header modification: `tx.transaction.signatures = []; await tx.sign();`

7. **Metro bundler caching:** React Native's Metro bundler aggressively caches JS bundles. When debugging transaction logic, always restart Metro with `--clear` flag: `npx expo start --clear`. Stale bundles are a common cause of "my code changes aren't working."

### 17.5 Koinos Community Resources

| Resource | URL | Notes |
|----------|-----|-------|
| Koinos Documentation | `docs.koinos.io` | Official docs — covers basics but lacks depth on mana/RC internals |
| Koinos Discord | `discord.koinos.io` | Active community — good for asking about contract behavior |
| Koilib Documentation | `joticajulian.github.io/koilib/` | API reference for koilib classes |
| Koinos Block Explorer | `koinosblocks.com` | Verify transactions, check account RC, view contract calls |

## 18. Current State & Pending Work (as of Feb 2026)

### Branch: `feature/ui_updates` (ALL changes UNCOMMITTED)

### What's Working:
- ✅ Free mana KOIN transfers (confirmed mined in block 33,218,462)
- ✅ Free mana VHP transfers (same pattern, implemented but less tested)
- ✅ MAX button caps at min(balance, currentMana) for KOIN
- ✅ Validation blocks amounts > currentMana with recharge time estimate
- ✅ Three-phase + retry loop handles authorize() RC overhead
- ✅ Mana recharge timer shows "You can send X KOIN in ~Xd Xh"
- ✅ Battery widget on HomeScreen with auto-refresh
- ✅ Auto-detect free mana toggle based on amount

### Pending:
- ⏳ **Commit all changes** — nothing is committed yet!
- ⏳ **Remove debug logging** — extensive `console.log` statements throughout SendScreen.tsx and koinos.ts. Strip for production.
- ⏳ **Test VHP transfers** with free mana on mainnet
- ⏳ **Protocol limitation awareness:** User cannot send more KOIN than their regenerated mana, even with free mana. This is an inherent KOIN contract constraint. Consider adding a "why can't I send more?" educational tooltip.
